# Tests

Running `haxe build.hxml` in the base directory compiles **Logipar** to its targets, and also creates these test files.

* `neko Test.n`  – runs the Neko test
* `python Test.py`  – runs the Python test
* `php php/index.php`  – runs the PHP test

These tests are defined in [/src/Test.hx](../src/Test.hx).
